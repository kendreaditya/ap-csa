I really dig this case. I’ve had several people comment on it, too. Some teenager(my daughter) even said, “dope case, pops”. I think that’s good?
As far as durability, I don’t know how well it would do if dropped. Hopefully, I’ll never have to find out. It does seem pretty sturdy. I can even charge my phone with my wireless charger with the case on.
