/* class - represents an object and has both attributes (propirties, adjs) and behaviors (actions, methods)
 * 	used to model a real world object and to protect that data inside of the class
 * 	every class declared as public must be saved with the same file name
 * 	Each class will  have their own .java and .class file
 * 
 * 	The keywords public and private are access modifiers, java aslo includes the keyword protected
 * 		public - any class/method can access it
 * 		private - only the class that it is defined it in may access it
 * 		protected - only the class and the subclasses can access it
 * 
 * 		variables are most of the time defined as private
 * 
 * 		Constructors - Special methods in a class which set the default values of your object's properties
 * 						don't really need constructors if using defulat values.
 * 						* HAS TO HAVE:
 * 							the same name as the class
 * 							no return type
 * 		
 * 		.set() and .get() methods - to change and access private varaibles in classes 
 * 
 * 		in order to create an object (class), we use the class creation expression:
 * 			Data today = new Date();			calls the defult constructor
 * 			Data toady = new Data(2020); 		calls specific constructor
 * 			
 * 
 * Object Oriented Programing Concepts
 * 		Encapsulation - package elements into a object called a struct or a class
 * 		Abstraction - reduces complexity and isolates the impact of changes to your code by using information hiding
 * 			Informtion Hiding - you don't need to know how something works to use it
 * 		Inheritance - eliminate redundant code bu creating object which can "inherit" varibles and function from each other, A subclass may inherit things from a superclass, subclass remains unchanged
 * 		Polymorphism - programing as cenerially as possible so that many object of different forms can be grouped under on common form
 *
